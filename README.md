# NFT_ART_GENERATOR
Random NFT ART GENERATOR using the Python Language

In this project I have made a program which generates random 'line' art, these are generated using the python language using PIL package, the program can generate any number of pics, these can then be made into a NFT art collection and sold on any NFT art hosting sites, the goal of this project is to understand how to generate art using Python language and having fun with creating new designs and interesting patterns.

The idea and coding for this project was helped by this youtube video --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMq2Jrvp9AA
